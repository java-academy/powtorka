= About

Refresher quiz from Java (and tools), by use of `fortune` game.

== Questions

1. OOP - theory of OO, including definition, author, criteria, pillars, etc.
2. exceptions - error and exception handling in Java
3. keywords - questions about all Java keywords (till JDK11)
3. jdbc - JDBC related questions (only simple ones, 21 of them now)

Extra:

- git - distributed version control system Git
- mvn - Maven, Java build tool

== Usage

From the terminal:

. `git clone this-repository`
. `cd powtorka` - change the dir name if you cloned or moved this elsewhere or renamed the dir name
. `strfile -c % fileNameHere` - creates a binary file DB for `fortune`
. `fortune fileNameHere` - uses the file, giving the random fortune (that is, a random question)
. `mv fileNameHere fileNameHere.dat /usr/share/games/fortunes` - assuming your fortune dir is `/usr/share/games/fortunes`
. you can now delete the repo and use the fortune-quiz :-)

`man fortune` to the rescue if you want to know more!
